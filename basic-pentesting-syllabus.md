## Introduction
It is a long journey. We need to prepare ourselves for adjusting ourselves to learn new methods and technique.
If someone is beginner, they can follow this syllabus to start the learning on penetration Testing.

## Programming
We should be good in writing code in any of one scripting language.

	1. Understanding Bash
	2. Understanding Python
	3. Learn Basic of Powershell
		

## Note Taking
Always take notes for future reference.

	3. Using Joplin
	4. Using CherryTerry

## Information Gathering
Most beginner will ignore this phase, as a result success rate is very low. I spend lots of time here!

	5. Passive Information Gathering
	6. Active Information Gathering

## Vulnerability Assessment
Enumerate Everything. Anything can be vulnerable!

	7. Finding Vulnerability Manually
	8. Nmap
	9. Burp Suites

## Exploitation
It can't be a hard core knowledge. We need skills to research on anything. To get used to it, We can practice as follows:

	10. Working with Public Exploits
	11. Compiling exploits in Linux
	12. OneLiner Reverse Shell
	13. Exploiting Various Services

		1. Exploiting FTP
		2. Exploiting SSH
		3. Exploit SMB
		4. Exploiting Network File System
		5. Exploiting SMTP
		6. Exploiting Other Running Service

	14. Exploiting Web(Getting Reverse Shell)

		1. SQL Injection
		2. OS Command Injection
		3. File Inclusion
		4. File Upload
		5. Code Execution

	15. Password Cracking using various tools
	16. Troubleshooting
		
## Stack Based Buffer Overflow
	1. Stack overflow without protection.
	2. SEH Bypass
	3. EGG Hunting
	4. Basic of DEP Bypass


## File Transfer
File Transfer should be easy for quick transfer!

	17. Transfering exploit in Linux in various way.
	18. Transfering exploit in Windows in various way.
		
## Tunneling
It is needed for lateral movement and accessing the private services.

	19. SSH
	20. plink
	21. sshtunnel
	22. chisel
	23. Metasploit
	24. Cobalt Strike

## Privilege Escaltion
If we have initial access, what now? Usually attempt to escalate to higher privileges.. right?

	25. Automated Analysis
		1. Linpeas
		2. LinEnum
		3. WinPeas
		4. PowerUp
		5. iCacls,etc.

	26. Manually
		1. Password Dumping
		2. Service Exploit
		3. SUID Exploit
		4. Weak File Permission
		5. DLL Hijacking
		6. Kernel Exploit
		7. Schedule Jobs, etc.

## Practice on LAB
Where can we practice?

	27. HTB(Best if we subscribe)
	28. Proving Ground(Real world Machine after subscription)
	28. TryHackMe(Best for beginner who love to follow walkthrough)


## Your turn
I am always practicing, what are you thinking about? Perhaps CEH? No Google also Can teach us! I am fan of `Try Harder` methods i have learned from the offensive-secrutiy. 

## Not Giving Up
Thinking to give up? Okay, Never come back! :)

## Conclusion
It is a long journey. There is no course either it is free or paid can teach us everything. We just need to learn to research. We always need to learn the new technique. We need to learn to trying the the things much more harder!
