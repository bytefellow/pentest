## Understanding Bash and Python
We should be good in writing code in any of one scripting language.

	1. Understanding Bash
	2. Understanding Python
	3. Learn Basic of Powershell
		

## Taking Note
Always take notes for future reference.

	3. Using Joplin
	4. Using CherryTerry

## Information Gathering
Most beginner will ignore this phase, as a result success rate is very low. I spend lots of time here!

	5. Passive Information Gathering
	6. Active Information Gathering

## Vulnerability Assessment
Enumerate Everything. Anything can be vulnerable!

	7. Finding Vulnerability Manually
	8. Nmap
	9. Burp Suites

## Exploitation
It can't be hard core knowledge. We need skills to research on anything. To get used to it, We can practice as follows:

	10. Working with Public Exploits
	11. Compiling exploits in Linux
	12. OneLiner Reverse Shell
	13. Exploiting Various Services

	1. Exploiting FTP

		4. File Upload
		5. Code Execution

	15. Password Cracking using various tools
	16. Troubleshooting
		
## Stack Based Buffer Overflow
	1. Stack overflow without protection.
	2. SEH Bypass.
	3. EGG Hunting
	4. Basic of DEP Bypass


## File Transfer
File Transfer need to be easy to follow

	17. Transfering exploit in Linux in various way.
	18. Transfering exploit in Windows in various way.

It is needed for lateral movement and accessing the private services.
	18. SSH
	19. plink
	20. sshtunnel
	21. chisel
	22. Metasploit
	23. Cobalt Strike

## Privilege Escaltion
If we have initial access, what now? Usually attempt to escalate to higher privileges.. right?

	24. Automated Analysis
		1. Linpeas
		2. LinEnum
		3. WinPeas

	25. Manually
		1. Password Dumping
		2. Service Exploit
		3. SUID Exploit
